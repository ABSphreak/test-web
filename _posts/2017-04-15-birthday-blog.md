I wrote this blog to sort of tell you my story about my life and how it all came to an existence. I worked very largely on massive Machine Learning Platforms and till date I am a very proficient programmer for making Machine Learning Projects that integrate like a charm with technologies like Hadoop Frameworks etc. Unfortunately I never had a chance to put my skills onto perspective for various silly reasons and I'd really like myself to be on the driving seat of a massive scaled project someday.
